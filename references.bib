	abstract = {In 2018, Costa Rica demonstrated its commitment to the Paris Agreement and published its Decarbonization Plan for achieving zero net emissions by the year 2050. We evaluate the impacts of the country's strategy for decarbonizing its Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sectors by coupling the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling framework with high-resolution spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM+ESM). Our results show that decarbonization of AFOLU would simultaneously enhance carbon storage, water purification, water regulation and erosion mitigation ecosystem services. Moreover, the positive cumulative wealth impact of decarbonization would be approximately US\$7.27 billion by 2050 while lifting an additional 3810 individuals out of poverty. From a public investment perspective, decarbonization would have a fiscally neutral impact with the economic benefits sufficient in magnitude to off-set policy implementation costs and generate economic returns of over US\$852 million when changes in natural capital stocks and environmental quality are considered. This application to Costa Rica is the first integrated economy-wide analysis of a growing number of decarbonization plans globally. The IEEM+ESM approach provides an integrated framework for analyzing decarbonization plans and can be used to refine AFOLU mitigation strategies to capitalize on synergies and minimize negative trade-offs across the three dimensions of wealth and sustainable economic development, namely economy, society and the environment.},

	abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty and protect the environment. The Government of Guatemala is prioritizing the SDGs it will focus on and defining lines of action to achieve them. In this paper, we apply the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modelling (IEEM) Platform for Guatemala to evaluate the economic, wealth and environmental impacts of strategies to achieve the second SDG of zero hunger and the sixth SDG of clean water and sanitation. The analytical power of the IEEM approach is driven by its integration of the first international standard for environmental statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting introduced in an earlier edition of this journal. This integration enables the evaluation of policy alternatives from economic, wealth and environmental perspectives which is essential given the integrated nature of the SDGs. We find that significant additional investment in agricultural productivity and water and sanitation would be required to meet these SDG targets and that the overall pace of economic growth is critical. IEEM applied to the SDGs lends transparency and structure to the prioritization and agenda setting process of the policy cycle and highlights the importance of allocating adequate resources in multi-year budgets if targets are to be met. IEEM can shed light on the need for complementary policies to reconcile lines of action that can make progress toward one SDG while inadvertently moving away from another SDG, as well as identify potential win-wins, where one line of action can make progress toward multiple SDGs simultaneously.},

	abstract = {The Amazon biome is being pushed by unsustainable economic drivers towards an ecological tipping point where restoration to its previous state may no longer be possible. This degradation is the result of self-reinforcing interactions between deforestation, climate change and fire. We assess the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts and trade-offs of scenarios representing movement towards an Amazon tipping point and strategies to avert one using the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform linked with spatial land use-land cover change and ecosystem services modeling (IEEM + ESM). Our approach provides the first approximation of the economic, natural capital and ecosystem services impacts of a tipping point, and evidence to build the economic case for strategies to avert it. For the five Amazon focal countries, namely, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, we find that a tipping point would create economic losses of US256.6 billion in cumulative gross domestic product by 2050. Policies that would contribute to averting a tipping point, including strongly reducing deforestation, investing in intensifying agriculture in cleared lands, climate-adapted agriculture and improving fire management, would generate approximately US339.3 billion in additional wealth and a return on investment of US\$29.5 billion. Quantifying the costs, benefits and trade-offs of policies to avert a tipping point in a transparent and replicable manner can support the design of regional development strategies for the Amazon biome, build the business case for action and catalyze global cooperation and financing to enable policy implementation.},

	abstract = {Conveying the importance of public conservation programs to Government decision makers is challenging given the long-term nature of investments in conservation and competition for scarce public resources. The effectiveness of conservation programs in terms of their impact on ecological and socioeconomic outcomes has been evaluated in the literature though not typically in an integrated way that enables the assessment of trade-offs across environmental, economic and social objectives. Through a novel approach that uses macroeconomic tools that incorporate land use-land cover change and ecosystem services, we conduct policy scenario analysis to investigate the economic, natural capital and ecosystem service impacts of three conservation programs in Mexico. We show their combined impact on Gross Domestic Product and wealth in 2035 to be US\$856.9 and US\$492.3 million, respectively and that the programs reduce poverty by 1,800 individuals. In addition to macroeconomic effects, our approach illustrates that by accounting for changes in regulating ecosystem service flows, cumulative Gross Domestic Product would be 1.34 times higher. Our results build a business case for ongoing investment and expansion of these conservation programs by demonstrating the benefits to biodiversity, natural capital and the economic well-being of Mexican society. The case study allows for replication in other countries as the tools and data employed are openly available for much of Latin America and the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and increasingly worldwide.},

A reduction in agricultural productivity would mean a considerable drop in crop and livestock production, and the resulting higher prices and lower household income would mean a significant reduction in the consumption of agricultural goods and food. The most negative effects of a drought would be concentrated in agriculture, given its intensive use of water. Because agricultural production is essential to ensuring food availability, these results suggest that Guatemala needs a proper water-distribution regulatory framework.},

	abstract = {Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most widely used measure of economic performance world-wide. Where long-run economic sustainability and human well-being are concerned, GDP can provide misleading policy advice. While the limitations of GDP are discussed conceptually in the literature, we provide a quantitative example demonstrating the implications of using only GDP to inform policy design. In the context of Colombia's post-conflict development, we show that continuing the recent trend of increasing deforestation reflects positively on GDP by about US\$59 million by 2035. However, when we consider the natural capital assets and environmental quality that underpin economic growth summarized by the Genuine Savings indicator of wealth, reducing deforestation and enhancing agricultural productivity results in a more prosperous and sustainable post-conflict future for Colombia with a US\$48 billion increase in wealth. Policy makers relying only on GDP as a guide to policy effectiveness risk undermining their country's development prospects and inter-generational well-being which is at the very core of sustainable development. While natural capital accounting sheds light on past economy-environment interactions, future looking integrated analytical frameworks such as that presented in this paper are required to evaluate policies on the basis of their potential impacts on sustainable economic development and wealth.},
